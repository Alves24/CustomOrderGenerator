# MEP - Custom application to generates orders for a waterproof paint factory

## About this project
This program was designed to generate sales orders, save customer information and prices.
It can communicate with the other application that I made for the same factory "CustomStockManager" to report orders and reduce stock.
It also generates an Excel file to print and archive the orders generated.

It cannot be used for another use! This app has custom business logic that is not configurable.

## More details
OOP based. 
I don't use a design pattern or SOLID principles, so the code is pretty horrible nowadays...
Use WinForms for the graphic interface.
SQLite
